<div style="border: 1px solid #fddd52; padding: 20px 20px 0px; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; ">
<p itemprop="description">The COVID-19 Data Forum brings together experts working to collect and curate data needed to drive scientific research and formulate effective public health responses to the pandemic.</p>
</div>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic is challenging science and society to an unprecedented degree. Human lives
and the future of our society are at stake. Containing the virus and flattening the curve" of the
pandemic depend on mounting a strong, coordinated, scientifically-informed public health response
which in turn ultimately depends on having complete and accurate data from multiple data
sources.</p>
<p>The <strong>COVID-19 Data Forum</strong> is an ongoing series of multidisciplinary webinars and
online meetings for topic experts to discuss data-related aspects of the scientific response to the
pandemic.  The Forum is a joint project of the <a href="https://r-consortium.org">R Consortium</a>
and the <a href="https://datascience.stanford.edu/">Stanford Data Science Institute</a>. We host
recurring topical webinars that are free and open to the public.</p>

<p>The Forum places particular emphasis on being open to all relevant interested groups and
including a wide range of expertise. With respect to computing, the Forum considers all useful
tools, languages and environments. We hope that the COVID-19 Data Forum discussions can usefully
proceed through three stages of questions:</p>

<ul class="bulleted">
<li>Where are we now, with respect to resources and needs?</li>
<li>What immediate steps (e.g. in terms of sharing) would make improvements?</li>
<li>What potential projects for new tools, standards, or data models might be worth
undertaking?</li>
</ul>

<p>At all stages, there are many specific topics that need discussion. To sort them out, three kinds
of activities are useful categories: obtaining the data; using the data; and communicating about the
data.</p>

<p><strong>Obtaining Data.</strong> COVID-19 data challenges begin with just acquiring data of the
range and quality needed. A very wide range of data is needed, in three dimensions: geographical,
time, and domain. Depending on the purpose, data may be needed either at very specific local levels
or at the widest global level. Both are challenging --- finding reliable local sources and resolving
hugely variable international ones, for example. Particularly on the global (or even national)
scale, variable quality will often be a challenge. Timeliness of the data is clearly essential,
particularly as public health regulations and other societal responses change. But scientific models
and analysis may also need to have data over a long time span. The pandemic has touched our lives in
many ways: directly in our health but also in nearly all aspects of our economy and society. As the
world responds, data science will need to consider all these aspects, requiring data from the
microscopic level of the virus to the population data for epidemiology, social science, and
economics.</p>

<p><strong>Using Data.</strong> The response to the COVID-19 pandemic from the scientific community
continues to generate crucial data-based results. Epidemiologists, public health experts, data
scientists, and other researchers have produced a large number of predictive models, interactive
resource allocation applications, and disease tracking dashboards. Moving ahead, it will be
important to have easy, consistent access to the best data for all these efforts. Co-operation and
co-ordination among the teams involved can enhance the scope and help ensure that model results and
comparisons use consistent, well-defined data sources.</p>

<p><strong>Communicating Data.</strong> A key goal of the Data Forum is to improve communication
between decision-makers (in public health, government, and elsewhere) and the data science and
general research community. Many tools have been developed for visualizing and interacting with
data. It's important to understand how these can be used and enhanced for the decision-making
community. We look forward to participation in our meetings by interested members of this community.
Another important goal is to improve the information flow to the broader community, with emphasis on
giving insight and avoiding misdirection.</p>

        <div class="description">
          <p>COVID-19 is the first pandemic to occur in the age of open data. Public health agencies around the world are releasing case counts to the public, and scientists are providing analyses and forecasts in real-time. However, the content of this data has so far been limited to simple metrics like cases, deaths, and hospitalizations at coarse geographic and demographic scales. To drive the next-phase of COVID-19, scientists need access to higher-dimensional patient-level data, so we can understand how the virus causes disease, why are some more at risk than others, when and how is transmission occurring, what therapeutics are more likely to work, and what healthcare resources are being used. But sharing such data brings up tremendous challenges in terms of patient privacy and data standardization. The COVID-19 Data Forum, a collaboration between Stanford University and the R Consortium, is hosting the event &#34;Beyond case counts: Making COVID-19 clinical data available and useful&#34; to push the conversation forward on these issues. The event will include talks by representatives from international collaborative teams who are working to collect and share detailed clinical and biological data from individuals with COVID-19.  The event will be open to the public, and is part of a continuing series focusing on data-related aspects of the scientific response to the pandemic.
