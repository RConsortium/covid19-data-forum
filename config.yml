    - title: "Beyond case counts: Making COVID-19 clinical data available and useful"
      date: "August 13, 2020"
      time: "9:00 AM San Francisco | 16:00 UTC"
      description: >
        COVID-19 is the first pandemic to occur in the age of open data. Public health agencies
        around the world are releasing case counts to the public, and scientists are providing
        analyses and forecasts in real-time. However, the content of this data has so far been
        limited to simple metrics like cases, deaths, and hospitalizations at coarse geographic and
        demographic scales. To drive the next-phase of COVID-19, scientists need access to
        higher-dimensional patient-level data, so we can understand how the virus causes disease,
        why are some more at risk than others, when and how is transmission occurring, what
        therapeutics are more likely to work, and what healthcare resources are being used. But
        sharing such data brings up tremendous challenges in terms of patient privacy and data
        standardization. The COVID-19 Data Forum, a collaboration between Stanford University and
        the R Consortium, is hosting the event "Beyond case counts: Making COVID-19 clinical data
        available and useful" to push the conversation forward on these issues. The event will
        include talks by representatives from international collaborative teams who are working to
        collect and share detailed clinical and biological data from individuals with COVID-19.  The
        event will be open to the public, and is part of a continuing series focusing on
        data-related aspects of the scientific response to the pandemic.
